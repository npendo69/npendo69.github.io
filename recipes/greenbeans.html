      Perfect Roasted Green Beans
      Have you tried roasted green beans? They’re new to me, so I’m excited to spread the word with this recipe! Roasted green beans are a light and healthy side dish to accompany heavier meals.
      Green beans are one of the quickest roasted veggie options since they’re ready after just 15 minutes in the oven. Like all roasted vegetables, roasted green beans taste intensified and caramelized, like more sophisticated versions of their raw or steamed states.
