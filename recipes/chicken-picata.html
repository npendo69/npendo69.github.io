            <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
            <p>It's pan-fried chicken in a piccata sauce, which is a combination of butter, oil, fresh lemon juice, and capers. Simple, right? The secret to making the best chicken piccata is having the perfect amount of lemon, and I've got you covered with this really easy chicken recipe.</p>
            <h2><u>Ingredients</u></h2>
            <ul>
               <li>Chicken</li>
               <li>Garlic Powder</li>
               <li>Flour</li>
               <li>Olive Oil</li>
               <li>Butter</li>
               <li>Chicken Broth</li>
               <li>Lemon Juice</li>
               <li>Lemon Zest</li>
               <li>Capers</li>
               <li>Heavy Cream</li>
               <li>Parsley</li>
            </ul>
            <h2><u>Steps</u></h2>
            <ol>
               <li>Slice the chicken breasts lengthwise (I butterfly then cut in half) to make 4 thinner cutlets. Trim off any fat. Season the chicken generously with salt & pepper and sprinkle with garlic powder. Coat the chicken in flour.</li>
               <li>Add 2 tablespoons of the butter plus the olive oil to a skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
               <li>Once the pan is hot, cook the chicken pieces for about 4-5 minutes per side until golden. Transfer the chicken to a plate.</li>
               <li>Take the pan off the heat and add the chicken broth, lemon juice, lemon zest, remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, and capers to the skillet. Scrape up any browned bits  </li>
               <li>Stir in the cream and return the pan to the heat. Once it's bubbling again, add the chicken back into the pan. If you want to make this recipe without cream, increase the chicken broth to 3/4 cup.</li>
               <li>Cook for another 5 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has reduced to your liking (you may need to turn down the heat a bit if it's bubbling furiously). If the sauce thickens too much, add more broth.</li>
               <li>Garnish with freshly chopped parsley and/or parmesan cheese if desired.</li>
            </ol>
